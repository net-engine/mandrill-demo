Mandrill Email Tracking API Demonstration
===

At NetEngine, we believe there are many perfectly nice wheels out in the wild, and have no immediate plans to invent any.

Just about every app we build sends emails, and as a rule, people tend to expect that such emails are delivered. We integrate with a number of 3rd party APIs for all sorts of reasons, and email is no different. A while ago we switched to Mandrill for all our SMTP mail servers, and this app served as a quick prototype for checking out their delivery and tracking API.

Basically, it allows a user to sign up, send themselves an email, and tracks the delivery status of said email. Simple.
